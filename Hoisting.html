In JavaScript, Hoisting is the default behavior of moving all the declarations at the top of the scope before code execution
JavaScript only hoists declarations, not the initializations.

Declaration –> Initialisation/Assignment –> Usage 

Note: Always remember that in the background the Javascript is first declaring the variable and then initializing them. It is also good to know that variable declarations are processed before any code is executed.
