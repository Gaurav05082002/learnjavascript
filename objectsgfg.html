    // objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, 
    // in the form of “key: value” pairs.
    // An object can be created with figure brackets {…} with an optional list of properties. A property is a “key: value” pair, where a key is a string (also called a “property name”), and value can be anything. 
    //  and functions are called method
